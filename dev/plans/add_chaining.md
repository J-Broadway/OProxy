# _add() Chaining Implementation Plan

## Overview

Enable chaining for _add() methods across OProxy classes to improve API fluency, aligning with _extend() behavior.

## Current State

- _add() currently returns None, preventing chaining.

## Proposed Changes

1. Update _add() in OPContainer, OPLeaf, etc., to return self after addition.

2. Ensure additions are properly stored and refreshed.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Method Updates

- Modify _add() to perform addition and return self.

### Phase 2: Testing

- Add chaining test cases.

- Verify no side effects on existing code.

## Benefits

- Consistent chaining API.

- Improved developer experience.

## Potential Concerns

- Backwards compatibility: Existing code expecting None return may need review (though unlikely).
